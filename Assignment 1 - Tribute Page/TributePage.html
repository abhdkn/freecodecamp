      <li><b>Tunnel View </b>provides one of the most famous views of Yosemite Valley. From here you can see El Capitan and Bridalveil Fall rising from Yosemite Valley, with Half Dome in the background. This viewpoint is at the east end of the Wawona Tunnel along the Wawona Road (Highway 41).</li>
      <li><b>El Capitan Meadow </b>provides a view straight up El Capitan and a great view of Cathedral Rocks, as well. Located along one-way Northside Drive, it is best to stop here on your way out of Yosemite Valley.</li>
      <li>You can look up <b>Yosemite Valley</b> from alongside the Merced River at Valley View. Located along one-way Northside Drive, it is best to stop here on your way out of Yosemite Valley. This popular vista is located just after a view of Bridalveil Fall but immediately before Pohono Bridge, about the time you begin to see directional signs for highways leaving the park.</li>
      <li>The area around <b>Sentinel Meadow </b> and the <b>Yosemite Chapel</b> is a favorite place to stop to look at Yosemite Falls.</li>
      <li><b>Sentinel Bridge</b> is famous for its views of both Half Dome reflected in the Merced River. You can also see Yosemite Falls nearby.</li>
      <li>Yosemite Valley Lodge (formerly Yosemite Lodge) and Lower Yosemite Fall provide a closer view of <b>Yosemite Falls.</b> A short walk takes you right to the bottom. Ok</li>
